## 👨‍🔬 Who am I?

A multilingual systems thinker, private researcher, machinist, AI explorer, and architect for AI-driven software development. The founder of **Black Epsilon Ltd.** and its small precision workshop in Sofia. My journey spans advanced machine shop design, scientific software architecture, cybersecurity, and the application of AI tools to solve real-world technical and scientific challenges.

_Not a programmer in the classical sense, but a technologist, analyst, and problem-solver. I design and direct complex software systems (for example, the Copernican Suite) and use AI coding tools like Codex as my primary “junior developer”, while I handle architecture, specification, and testing. I thrive on guiding AI-assisted development workflows, designing zero-trust-inspired network architectures, and leading complex, multidisciplinary projects._

## 🛠️ What I Do

- **Cybersecurity & Zero-Trust Networking:** Designed layered, zero-trust-inspired network architecture for a CNC-equipped lab, including segmented NAT subnets, air-gapped zones, and secure remote access.
- **Scientific Software Architecture (Copernican Suite):** Created and direct the Copernican Suite, a Python-based cosmological inference and model-comparison framework with YAML-defined models and run manifests, pluggable MCMC and nested-sampling engines, dataset registry, LaTeX-aware reporting and a strict development policy (AGENTS, pre-commit hooks, tests, metadata checks). I specify behaviour and test outputs while AI coding tools implement most of the Python.  
  [🔗 Copernican Suite](https://github.com/apostolovbg/copernican)
- **Mechanical & Electrical Engineering:** Built an ~50 m² personal machine shop and R&D lab, [Black Epsilon Lab](https://github.com/apostolovbg/black-epsilon-lab), with manual machines and a small CNC router, full metrology corner and microscope station, designing and installing the electrical system, lighting zones, plumbing, drywall, ceiling grid and network myself.
- **AI-Directed Learning & Debugging:** Utilize AI tools for diagnosing CNC control board failures, generating G-code and CNC toolpaths, and developing workflow enhancements.
- **Multilingual & Intercultural Communication:** Interpreter-level English; broad fluency across four language families; extensive international project coordination and technical writing.
