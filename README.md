## üë®‚Äçüî¨ Who am I?

I am a multilingual systems thinker, private researcher, machinist, AI explorer, and architect for AI-driven software development. My journey spans advanced machine shop design, scientific software architecture, cybersecurity, and the application of AI tools to solve real-world technical and scientific challenges.

_Not a programmer in the classical sense, but a visionary technologist, analyst, and problem-solver. I thrive on guiding AI-assisted development workflows, designing secure zero-trust network architectures, and leading complex, multidisciplinary projects._

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Do

- **Cybersecurity & Zero-Trust Networking:** Designed layered, enterprise-grade zero-trust infrastructure for a CNC-equipped machine shop, including segmented NAT subnets, air-gapped zones, and secure cloud proxies.
- **Scientific Software Architecture (Copernican Suite):** Led the design and refactor of a Python-based cosmology testing suite, including a declarative JSON-to-Python runtime compiler for symbolic physics models.  
  [üîó Copernican Suite](https://github.com/apostolovbg/copernican)
- **Mechanical & Electrical Engineering:** Built a 47‚ÄØm¬≤ personal machine shop and R&D lab, handling everything from equipment selection to high-voltage electrical and network design.
- **AI-Directed Learning & Debugging:** Utilized AI tools for diagnosing CNC control board failures, generating G-code, and developing workflow enhancements.
- **Multilingual & Intercultural Communication:** Interpreter-level English; broad fluency across four language families; extensive international project coordination and technical writing.
